                        belongs to everyone.
                        Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras
                        merchandise or an
                        "official" Mardi
                        Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their
                        products or
                        services to those
                        who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government

                        individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts
                        of the
                        country, official
                        organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
                        Orleans.

                        (Feast of the
                        Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each
                        year.

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday
                        each year.
                        Fat Tuesday is
                        always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day
                        and stay
                        through Ash
                        Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through

                        Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s
                        a good idea
                        to layer your
                        clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes
                        that can
                        get somewhat dirty.
                        Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then

                        the biggest
                        parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are

                        Gras is a
                        family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our
                        children
                        have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we used to use
                        "taking the
                        children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all
                        of the stuff
                        they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no
                        full-size parades
                        pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles
                        Avenue near
                        Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The
                        Garden District
                        portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking
                        out their
                        parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                        beautiful
                        oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in
                        this area
                        during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas
                        like
                        Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar
                        parade, the
                        Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi
                        Gras day.
