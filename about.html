        <h1>About the Mardi Gras</h1>
        <h2>The History behind the Holidays</h2>
        <p class="innertext">
            The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and
            18th
            centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted
            calf,
            followed France to her colonies.</p>
        <p class="innertext">
            On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of
            ground 60
            miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the
            eve of the
            festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In
            1703, the
            tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current
            Mardi
            Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711
            through 1861.
            The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
            with an
            actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
            Orleans, but
            not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
            established
            elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing
            body.
            That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
            carnival
            organizations formed in New Orleans.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
            celebrate
            Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each
            event an
            exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
            invoking
            John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans
            with
            dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded
            account
            of Mardi Gras "throws."
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
            lithographs of
            parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always carefully
            guarded
            before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
            beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced
            in full,
            saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
            B.A.
            Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges
            Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first
            daytime
            parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced Romanoff's
            family
            colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power;
            and green
            for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love,"
            was
            cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France, culminating
            with
            Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal
            costumes
            served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
            Warmoth. In
            1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which
            it still
            is.
        </p>
        <p class="innertext">
            Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social clubs
            with
            restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by their
            members, New
            Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
